# Introduction to RISC-V ISA 

A RISC-V ISA is defined as a base integer ISA, which must be present in any implementation, plus optional extensions to the base ISA. Each base integer instruction set is characterized by
  1. Width of the integer registers (XLEN) 
  2. Corresponding size of the address space
  3. Number of integer registers (32 in RISC-V)

More details on RISC-V ISA can be obtained [here](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/draft-20200727-8088ba4/riscv-spec.pdf).

# Overview of GNU compiler toolchain

The GNU Toolchain is a set of programming tools in Linux systems that programmers can use to make and compile their code to produce a program or library. So, how the machine code which is understandable by processer is explained below.

  * Preprocessor - Process source code before compilation. Macro definition, file inclusion or any other directive if present then are preprocessed. 
  * Compiler - Takes the input provided by preprocessor and converts to assembly code.
  * Assembler - Takes the input provided by compiler and converts to relocatable machine code.
  * Linker - Takes the input provided by Assembler and converts to Absolute machine code.
